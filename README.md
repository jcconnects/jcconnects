## 🤗 About Me

I'm a **Computer Science student** at UFSC and **DevOps Engineer** passionate about building quality solutions through meaningful connections. My approach is all about creating bridges that enable clear, collaborative communication while sharing knowledge and implementing solutions that truly make a difference.

The concept behind **jcconnects** is simple yet powerful: everything great happens through connections 🤝 Whether it's connecting technologies, teams, or ideas, I believe in fostering collaboration that leads to reliable, well-organized projects that exceed expectations.
